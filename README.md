1.   QUESTION/ DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY
This is an individual written assignment.Acting as an HRD consultant, you are asked to design a leadership or management development intervention   with an emphasis on sustainability   for an organisation of your choice. The organisation must have a clear sustainability agenda. The intervention must NOT draw on an existing programme/intervention.Your assignment should address/include the following:·   Work through ALL the stages of the HRD cycle   and explain how each stage will be designed and implemented.·   Justify how your intervention is aligned to the sustainability strategy/goals of your chosen organisation.·   Cost the proposal and make a case for the resources required.·   Use the academic literature to frame, develop and justify, and critically evaluate your approach.·   Write a short critical reflection as a conclusion on the key skills and roles needed by an HRD practitioner in the realisation of this intervention within the specific organisational context and the implications for their CPD.
2.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional guidelines
·   Choose your organisation carefully: it must be an organisation with a stated sustainability agenda/strategy/goals – it can be of any nationality but must have an English-language website. Include a link to the website in the assignment.
·   Find a statement on the website or other documentation relating to its sustainability agenda.
·   Think about the HRD implications of this agenda.
·   Analyse what the learning needs might be for leaders or managers to lead/manage this strategy. You probably won’t have access to organisational members so you will have to deduce their needs in accordance with espoused organisational strategy.
·   Think about the internal and external contexts of the organisation – how will these affect HRD needs?
·   How will the training intervention be aligned to the organisational sustainability agenda (vertical, horizontal or both)?
·   Lay out the learning design – think about the format (face-to-face, online blended, etc.) and justify your choice(s) according to the learning aims/objectives, context and logistics. You can put sample materials in an appendix if you wish.
·   How does this design allow for human diversity (think about learning styles, preferences etc.) and possible cultural differences (for example, think about the countries that this organisation is operating in and the needs of expatriate leaders/managers)?
·   State how the training is going to be delivered (who is going to do it, where and when will it take place etc).
·   Anticipate any problems which might arise and how you would overcome them.
·   Draw up a budget for your intervention and justify the cost. State how you will ‘sell’ this plan to the senior management (especially if it goes over budget or includes some expensive items); might there be any unexpected/hidden costs to account for?
·   Explain how you will evaluate the intervention – think about what you (and your organisation) need to know from the evaluation. This should be aligned to the evaluation theories you draw on, what types of evaluation you employ and when it is conducted.
·   Who would you feedback the results to and why?
·   What measures would you put in place for continuing improvement?
·   What key skills would a HRD practitioner need to have and what roles would they need to play to realise this intervention within the specific organisational context? What might be most challenging and how might they hone and develop these through CPD along the way?
Additional Points and Tips
·   Refer to theory throughout!
·   You can draw on lecture material and set readings but ensure to evidence appropriate further reading (suggested and beyond) throughout as well.
·   You must refer to the four-stage HRD cycle model; however, if you wish to also refer to some of the more complex models you can.
·   Please engage critically with the theory and models you employ, including the HRD cycle model itself! How have they been critiqued? What are their strengths and shortcomings for your purposes? How can the shortcomings be addressed?
·   Please do NOT use the same organisation as your classmates.
·   Report: Please make sure that your submission includes an introduction, main body and conclusion. Include a cover page with assignment topic and word count detailed. Use headings, sections and paragraphs and avoid bullet points.
·   Language: your project should be written in British, not American, English.
·   Referencing style: All pieces of assessment should use the Harvard style. of referencing throughout.
·   Be as creative as you like!
